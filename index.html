<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<p>My name is Fabiola and I'm a master's student in the University of Geneva. I'm currently doing a master's degree in Multilingual Communication Technology and as the name says it's mainly about technologies related to multilingualism and therefore to translation. I'm 26 years old and my home country is Puerto Rico. If you want to know more about my educational background head to the Education Page. </p>
