# Studying at the FTI

My name is Fabiola and I'm a student at the [University of Geneva](http://unige.ch).   I'm on the first graduating class of the new master's program [*Multilingual Communication Technologies*](https://www.unige.ch/fti/en/enseignements/ma-tim/) of the Faculty Translation and Interpretation. 

### This MA explores the following topics related to translation's technologies: ###
- Automatic translation
- Terminology
- Localization
- Project management
- Corpus
- Linguistic Engineering
- XML

***To help students get to know each other and do interesting activities there are several university-wide associations and there's also the association of the faculty [AETI](http://www.asso-etud.unige.ch/aeti/).**
